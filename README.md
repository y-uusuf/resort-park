# Resort Park (Mini Employer Set Project) üèÇ

The resort park ticketing system should include user authentication for admin access, enabling secure management of ticket operations. Key functionalities will encompass the ability to add, view, delete, and update tickets, alongside tracking sales to monitor total revenue generated. Users should be able to search for specific tickets based on criteria such as date or type. Admin features will allow for the modification of login credentials and the generation of sales reports. A simple command-line interface will facilitate user navigation, with clear prompts and feedback messages. Additionally, the system will implement data persistence to retain ticket information across sessions, incorporate error handling for invalid inputs, and provide help or documentation to assist users in effectively utilizing the system.
